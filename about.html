        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>We aim to provide a centralized platform for philatelists across India to share their passion for collecting, learning, and preserving postal history through stamps.</p>

        <h2>What is Philately?</h2>
        <p>Philately is the study and collection of postage stamps and other related postal materials. It involves more than just collecting stamps—it’s about understanding the stories, history, and culture that these stamps represent.</p>

        <h2>About Philatelists</h2>
        <p>A philatelist is someone who actively collects and studies stamps, covers, and other postal materials. Philatelists may focus on different aspects of stamp collecting, such as thematic collections, historical stamps, or postal history, and often share their findings with a wider community.</p>

        <h2>Philatelic Materials</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Postage Stamps:</strong> Stamps are small adhesive labels issued by a postal authority to show that postage has been paid. Stamps can depict significant historical events, famous people, wildlife, art, and more.</li>
            <li><strong>First Day Covers (FDC):</strong> These are envelopes with stamps that are canceled on the first day the stamp is issued, usually with a special design related to the theme of the stamp.</li>
            <li><strong>Postal History:</strong> This includes old letters, envelopes, postmarks, and other materials that show how mail was processed and delivered in the past.</li>
            <li><strong>Commemorative Stamps:</strong> These are stamps issued to honor a specific event, person, or milestone and are often released in limited quantities, making them valuable to collectors.</li>
        </ul>
